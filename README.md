# PSY6422_myproject
Final R project for PSY6422: Deaths caused by Dementia and Parkinson's disease in the UK, USA and the World between 1990 and 2016

The aim of this project is to visualise the share of deaths caused by Dementia and Parkinson's disease in three different regions. These included the UK and USA due to their cultural similarities, as well as both being developed countries with considerable contributions to the global economy. Data representing the world as a whole was also collected as it allows for 

The downloaded data, in the form of a .csv file, can be found in the 'data' folder. The downloaded visualisations can be found in the 'figs' folder. 

The interactive plots made with shiny, using the package Plotly, allow for full interactivity of the plot. Once the visualisations have been clicked on, at the top right hand corner of the visualisations, there are a set of options to interact with the plots. These include 'download plot as a png', 'zoom in', 'zoom out', 'compare data on hover' and more. This allows for easily comparable bars, whilst also allowing for visualisation of a single region (by double-clicking on the country/region in the key). Due to there being 3 different regions, it also allows for comparibility between 2 regions of your choice.
